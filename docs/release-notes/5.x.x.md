- Fix(eos_designs): Wrong duplicate detection between SVIs and L2VLANs by @gmuloc in https://github.com/aristanetworks/avd/pull/5025

## Release 5.2.0

### Changes to requirements

- Python requirements:
  - AVD now requires ansible-core from **2.16.0** to **2.18.x**.
    The latest version can be installed with `pip install "ansible-core<2.19" --upgrade`.

### Fix for merging of node variables if a device is defined twice

With variables like below, where `myswitch1` is specified both under the `nodes` and under `node_groups[].nodes`,
AVD would wrongfully ignore the variables under the `node_groups[]` and `node_groups[].nodes` in versions below 5.1.

```yaml
<node_type_key like l3leaf>:
  nodes:
    - name: myswitch1
      id: 1

  # Everything below node_groups would be ignored in older versions for devices found under `nodes`.
  node_groups:
    - group: mygroup1
      filters:
        tags:
          - mytag
      nodes:
        - name: myswitch1
          mgmt_ip: 192.168.200.10/24
```

Starting with version 5.2, AVD follows the [documented behavior](https://avd.arista.com/5.0/roles/eos_designs/docs/input-variables.html#node-type-structure).

### Fix for incorrect output in prefix-list PL-LOOPBACKS-EVPN-OVERLAY when given incorrect prefixes for IPv4 Loopback pools

When IPv4 Loopback pools contain IP prefixes with host bits set like `192.168.100.11/24` AVD previously relayed this wrong prefix directly:

```eos
ip prefix-list PL-LOOPBACKS-EVPN-OVERLAY
   seq 10 permit 192.168.100.11/24 eq 32
```

This config is incorrect and EOS automatically changes it to the correct prefix `192.168.100.0/24` when the configuration is applied.

Starting with version 5.2, AVD changes the prefix internally to output the correct prefix:

```eos
ip prefix-list PL-LOOPBACKS-EVPN-OVERLAY
   seq 10 permit 192.168.100.0/24 eq 32
```

This may lead to updates in the generated configurations, but it will not affect the running configuration, since EOS already corrected this automatically.

- Refactor(eos_designs): Use new isis_authentication data models by @ClausHolbechArista in https://github.com/aristanetworks/avd/pull/4734

## Release 5.0.0

### Changes to requirements

- Python requirements:
  - AVD v.5.0.0 requires Python version 3.10 or newer.
  - AVD now requires the `cvprac` Python library to be version 1.4.0 or higher.<br>
    The latest version can be installed with `pip install "cvprac>=1.4.0" --upgrade`.
- Ansible collection requirements:
  - Minimum `arista.cvp` version 3.11.0.

### Removal of Ansible components

The following ansible components have been removed from the `arista.avd` Ansible collection in v5.0.0.

Filters:

- `arista.avd.convert_dicts`
- `arista.avd.hash_passphrase`
- `arista.avd.generate_esi`
- `arista.avd.generate_lacp_id`
- `arista.avd.generate_route_target`

Action plugins / Modules:

- `arista.avd.deploy_to_cv`
- `arista.avd.batch_template`
- `arista.avd.validate_and_template`
- `arista.avd.yaml_templates_to_facts`
- `arista.avd._emit_warning`

Roles:

- `arista.avd.deploy_to_cv`

See the [porting guide](../porting-guides/5.x.x.md#removal-of-ansible-components) for details.

### Removal of Ansible tags from AVD roles

Support for Ansible tags across AVD roles has been replaced with variables to control the execution of various parts of AVD.

The previous implementation of Ansible tags needed to be more consistent, and they were mostly undocumented. It often led to inconsistent behaviors depending on when the tags were used with `--tags` vs. `--skip-tags`.

See the [porting guide](../porting-guides/5.x.x.md#removal-of-ansible-tags-from-avd-roles) for details.

### Data model changes from "dict-of-dicts" to "list-of-dicts"

In AVD 4.0.0 and across both `eos_designs` and `eos_cli_config_gen`, *all* "dict-of-dicts" data models with user-defined keys were changed to "list-of-dicts".
In AVD 4.x inputs were auto-converted to the new data models.

As of AVD 5.0.0 the automatic conversion from dict-of-dicts has been removed, so it is required to update the input data to the new data models.
The `avd_data_conversion_mode` key has also been removed.

See the [porting guide](../porting-guides/5.x.x.md#data-model-changes-from-dict-of-dicts-to-list-of-dicts) for details.

### All eos_designs and eos_cli_config_gen variables are always validated by schemas

In AVD 5.0.0, all `eos_designs` and `eos_cli_config_gen` keys are validated by schemas and execution will stop for any violations.
If additional custom keys are desired, a key starting with an underscore `_` will be ignored by validation.

!!! danger
    The input variable `avd_data_validation_mode` now has a default value of `error`, and while it can be set to `warning`, this is highly discouraged.
    All AVD code relies on the validation to ensure valid data, so the code assumes that the data is valid.

    If the validation mode is set to `warning`, execution will continue with invalid data, which can lead to hard-to-read errors or incorrect behavior.

### Breaking or behavioral changes in eos_designs

Breaking changes may require modifications to the inventory or playbook. See the [Porting guide for AVD 5.x.x](../porting-guides/5.x.x.md#changes-to-role-aristaavdeos_designs)
for details.

### Breaking or behavioral changes in eos_validate_state

Starting AVD 5.0.0, `eos_validate_state` uses ANTA as backend, which will change the default behavior (same as setting `use_anta: true` in the latest AVD 4.x.x versions).
If you have not been using `use_anta: true` in latest versions of AVD 4.x.x, please go through the following sections for details on the changes.

Breaking changes may require modifications to the inventory, input variables or playbooks. See the [Porting guide for AVD 5.x.x](../porting-guides/5.x.x.md#changes-to-role-aristaavdeos_validate_state)
for details.

#### Loose mode is the only supported mode

In the previous implementation, loose mode was used by default to avoid stopping the playbook and hence the tests when they were run task by task in Ansible. It was possible to turn loose mode off with a variable `eos_validate_state_validation_mode_loose: false` that would make the playbook stop at the first failing tasks for whatever reason on each host.

Loose mode is now the default and all the tests are always run and the errors are all present in the final report.

#### Input for hardware tests have been updated

The inputs for the hardware test have changed. See the [porting guide](../porting-guides/5.x.x.md#input-for-hardware-tests-have-been-updated) for details.

#### Filtering tests using Ansible tags support was removed

Instead use the `skip_tests` mechanism. See the [porting guide](../porting-guides/5.x.x.md#filtering-tests-using-ansible-tags-support-was-removed) for details.

#### Changes to CSV and Markdown reports

- Hardware tests are now collapsed.
- Sorting of test results is now done per device as opposed to per category.
- Test categories, descriptions and inputs have been improved to follow ANTA.
- CSV report headers updated from `test_id,node,test_category,test_description,test,result,failure_reason` to `id,dut,categories,test,description,inputs,result,messages`
- Tests skipped by ANTA will be marked as `SKIPPED` in the final reports.

#### Undeployed devices

- All tests will be removed from the catalog for a device flagged as undeployed using the host level variable [`is_deployed: false`](https://avd.arista.com/en/stable/roles/eos_designs/docs/input-variables.html#flagging-a-device-as-not-deployed).
- Additionally, the per-device generated test catalog takes into account the `is_deployed` variable value from the peer devices (e.g. a ping test towards an undeployed peer is not generated).

!!! warning
    Tests can also be automatically removed from the catalogs depending on the structured configuration of the devices. ANTA is therefore not aware of these tests and they will not appear in the final report. For example, the `AvdTestMLAG` tests will not be present in the test catalog of a device that does not have an MLAG configuration in its structured configuration.

#### BGP test change

- BGP tests will only run if `service_routing_protocols_model` is set to `multi-agent` in the structured configuration file.

!!! note
    Starting from version 4.30.1F, the service routing protocols is set to `multi-agent` on EOS devices by default. Details are available [here](https://www.arista.com/en/support/toi/eos-4-30-1f/17697-use-multi-agent-as-default-routing-protocols-model) (TOI article is only available for registered users).

#### Inband management reachability test change

- Inband management reachability test has been refactored to support AVD inband management [data model](https://avd.arista.com/en/stable/roles/eos_designs/docs/input-variables.html#node-type-inband-management).
