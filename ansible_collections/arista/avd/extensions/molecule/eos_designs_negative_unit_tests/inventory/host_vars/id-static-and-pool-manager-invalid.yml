  When 'fabric_numbering.node_id.algorithm' is set to 'pool_manager', any 'id' set for the node will be reserved in the pool if possible.
  The given 'id: 0' is not a valid Node ID for the Pool Manager. The 'id' setting must either be removed or changed.
  If you prefer to keep the 'id' setting, the next available value is 1 for host 'id-static-and-pool-manager-invalid'.
