module: anta_workflow
version_added: "5.3.0"

short_description: Uses ANTA from Ansible
description: |-
  The `arista.avd.anta_workflow` module is an Ansible Action Plugin to leverage the ANTA test
  framework to validate that the generated structured configurations by AVD are applied to the
  devices and that the deployed network is working correctly. It can also be used to execute
  user-defined ANTA test catalogs in conjunction with the Ansible inventory, providing similar
  functionality and options as the ANTA CLI while benefiting from Ansible's inventory management
  capabilities.

  The plugin offers the following capabilities:

  - Generating a per-device test catalog based on the AVD structured configuration.
  - Running AVD-generated test catalogs against the devices.
  - Running user-defined test catalogs against the devices.
  - Generating reports in various formats.
  - In dry-run mode, only the test catalogs are generated, and a report is created to preview the tests that would be run against each device.
