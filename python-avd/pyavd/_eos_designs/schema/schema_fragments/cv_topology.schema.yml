    description: |-
      Generate AVD configurations directly from the given CloudVision topology.
      Activate this feature by setting `use_cv_topology` to `true`.
      Interfaces are assigned according to the following rules:
        - All interfaces connected to the MLAG peer (only other device in the same node group) will be `mlag_interfaces`.
        - For connections between devices with different `cv_topology_levels[type=<type>].level`, the lowest level will be considered the "parent switch"
          and the highest level will be considered the "child switch".
        - Connections between devices with the same `cv_topology_levels[type=<type>].level` will be ignored and must be created manually.
        - The first Management interface is assigned as `mgmt_interface` unless it is set for the node or under platform_settings.
      Neighbor hostnames must match the inventory hostnames of the AVD inventory to be taken into consideration.
