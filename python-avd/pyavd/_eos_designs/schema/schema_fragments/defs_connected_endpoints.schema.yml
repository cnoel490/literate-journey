                  This can be a template using the AVD string formatter syntax: https://avd.arista.com/stable/ansible_collections/arista/avd/roles/eos_designs/docs/how-to/custom-descriptions-names.html#avd-string-formatter-syntax.
                  The available template fields are:
                    - `endpoint_type` - the `type` from `connected_endpoints_keys` like `server`, `router` etc.
                    - `endpoint` - The name of the connected endpoint
                    - `endpoint_port` - The value from `endpoint_ports` for this switch port if set.
                    - `port_channel_id`: The port-channel number for the switch.
