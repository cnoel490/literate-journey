          Assignment policy for Node ID.
          Node ID is mainly used for IP address assignment but can also affect BGP AS and/or
          interface assignments depending on other settings.

            valid_values:

              IDs will be automatically assigned according to the configured algorithm.
              - `static` will use the statically set IDs under node setting.
              - `pool_manager` will activate the pool manager for ID pools.
                Any statically set ID under node settings will be reserved in the pool if possible.
                Otherwise an error will be raised.
          pools_file:
            type: str
            description: |-
              Path to file to use for storing ID pool data when using "pool_manager" as algorithm.
              This can be an absolute path or a path relative to current working directory.

              By default the path is: `<root_dir>/intended/data/<fabric_name>-ids.yml`.

              Note: Since the pool manager will remove stale entries after every run, each fabric should be using its own file.
