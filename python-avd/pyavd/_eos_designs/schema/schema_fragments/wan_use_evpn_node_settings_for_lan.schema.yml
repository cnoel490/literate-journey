      PREVIEW: This key is currently not supported and may produce invalid configuration.
      When true, `eos_designs` will use `overlay_routing_protocol`, `evpn_role` and `vtep`
      node settings for LAN side on WAN devices. Otherwise these will be ignored for WAN.
      This will be the default in AVD version 6.0.0 and this option will be removed.
