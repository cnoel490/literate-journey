      - The following overlay routing protocols are supported:
        - ebgp: Configures fabric with eBGP, default for l3ls-evpn design.
        - ibgp: Configured fabric with iBGP, only supported with OSPF or ISIS variants in underlay, default for mpls design.
        - cvx: Configures fabric to leverage CloudVision eXchange as the overlay controller.
        - her: Configures fabric with Head-End Replication, configures static VXLAN flood-lists instead of using a dynamic overlay protocol.
        - none: No overlay configuration will be generated, default for l2ls design.

        If not set, the default_overlay_routing_protocol defined under the node_type_keys will be used (default is "ebgp").
