          The value will be interpreted according to these rules:
            - `use_mgmt_interface` will configure the `mgmt_interface` as the local interface.
            - `use_inband_mgmt_interface` will configure the `inband_mgmt_interface` as the local interface.
            - `use_default_mgmt_method_interface` will configure `mgmt_interface` or `inband_mgmt_interface` as the local interface depending on the value of `default_mgmt_method`.
            - Any other string will be used directly as the local interface.
