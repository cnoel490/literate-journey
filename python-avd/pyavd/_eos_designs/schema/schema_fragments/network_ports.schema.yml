            Regex matching the full platform name of one or more switches. If used in combination with switch hostname matching, both criteria must match for configuration.
            If you need to add custom platforms to match specific port quantities, create them under `custom_platform_settings`. Entries under `custom_platform_settings` should
            match the platform match criteria.

            For example, `720XP-48Y6` would require a custom platform type:

            platforms:
              - 720XP
              - 720XP-48Y6

            List of ranges using AVD range_expand syntax.
            For example:

            switch_ports:
              - Ethernet1
              - Ethernet2-48

            All switch_ports ranges are expanded into individual port configurations.

            For more details and examples of the `range_expand` syntax, see the [`arista.avd.range_expand` documentation](../../../../../../docs/plugins/Filter_plugins/range_expand.md).

            Description or description template to be used on all ports.
            This can be a template using the AVD string formatter syntax: https://avd.arista.com/stable/ansible_collections/arista/avd/roles/eos_designs/docs/how-to/custom-descriptions-names.html#avd-string-formatter-syntax.
            The available template fields are:
              - `endpoint_type` - always set to `network_port`.
              - `endpoint` - content of the `endpoint` key if set.
              - `port_channel_id`: The port-channel number for the switch.

            The default description is set by `default_network_ports_description`.
            By default the description is templated from the `endpoint` key if set.
        endpoint:
          type: str
          description: Name or description of the endpoints connected to these ports.
