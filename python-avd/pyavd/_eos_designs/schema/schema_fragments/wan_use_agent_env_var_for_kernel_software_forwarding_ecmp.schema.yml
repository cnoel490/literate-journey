      For EOS kernel forwarding, ECMP programming can be enabled in two different ways depending on the EOS version.

      - `true`: For older EOS versions use an agent environment variable. Changing this requires a restart of the KernelFib agent.
      - `false`: For newer EOS versions (starting 4.33.2) use the proper CLI.
