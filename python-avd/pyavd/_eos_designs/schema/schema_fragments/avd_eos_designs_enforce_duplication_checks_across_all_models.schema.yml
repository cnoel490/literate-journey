      PREVIEW: This option is marked as "preview", while we refactor the code to conform to the described behavior.
      When this is enabled, the generation of Structured Config in `eos_designs` will prevent duplicate objects generated
      by different input models. This will also improve performance since `eos_designs` will not maintain separate copied of the Structured Configuration.
      As an example, if you define an Ethernet interface under `l3_edge` and use the same interface for connectivity under `servers`:
      - With this option disabled (default), AVD will merge these configurations together for the interface and not raise an error.
      - With this option enabled, AVD will raise an error about duplicate interface definitions.
