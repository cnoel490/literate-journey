    description: |
      This feature allows pure IPv6 underlay routing protocol with numbered addresses.
      Currently sets both underlay and overlay, including MLAG, to use IPv6 addresses.
      Currently BGP peer-groups are named with IPv4 by default. This can be modified under `bgp_peer_groups`.
      Requires:
        - "underlay_ipv6: true"
        - "loopback_ipv6_pool"
        - "underlay_routing_protocol: ebgp"
      Some settings are not yet supported with IPv6 underlay:
        - underlay_multicast_pim_sm
        - underlay_multicast_rp_interfaces
        - underlay_rfc5549
        - wan_role
        - vtep_vvtep_ip
        - inband_ztp
    type: bool
    default: false
